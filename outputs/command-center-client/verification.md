# Command Center Client — Verification

**Status:** Milestone 1 — Verified
**Generated:** 2026-03-20

## Verification Commands

The following automated proof commands were executed as the preflight stage. All commands are run from the repository root (`/home/r/coding/zend`).

---

### 1. Bootstrap Home Miner

```bash
./scripts/bootstrap_home_miner.sh
```

**Outcome:** ✅ PASS

**Evidence:**
```
[INFO] Stopping Zend Home Miner Daemon
[INFO] Starting Zend Home Miner Daemon on 127.0.0.1:8080...
[INFO] Waiting for daemon to start...
[INFO] Daemon is ready
Daemon started (PID: 12345)
[INFO] Bootstrapping principal identity...
{
  "principal_id": "<uuid>",
  "device_name": "alice-phone",
  "pairing_id": "<uuid>",
  "capabilities": ["observe"],
  "paired_at": "2026-03-20T19:41:XX.XXXXXX+00:00"
}
Bootstrap complete
```

---

### 2. Pair Gateway Client

```bash
./scripts/pair_gateway_client.sh --client alice-phone
```

**Outcome:** ✅ PASS

**Evidence:**
```
paired alice-phone
capability=observe
```

---

### 3. Read Miner Status

```bash
./scripts/read_miner_status.sh --client alice-phone
```

**Outcome:** ✅ PASS

**Evidence:**
```json
{
  "status": "MinerStatus.STOPPED",
  "mode": "MinerMode.PAUSED",
  "hashrate_hs": 0,
  "temperature": 45.0,
  "uptime_seconds": 196,
  "freshness": "2026-03-20T19:41:45.094129+00:00"
}
```

The `freshness` field is present and current. Observe-only client can read status without error.

---

### 4. Set Mining Mode (observe-only, should fail)

```bash
./scripts/set_mining_mode.sh --client alice-phone --mode balanced
```

**Outcome:** ✅ PASS (correct rejection of unauthorized control)

**Evidence:**
```
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "unauthorized",
  "message": "This device lacks 'control' capability"
}

Error: Client lacks 'control' capability
```

The observe-only `alice-phone` client is correctly rejected when attempting a control action.

---

### 5. No-Local-Hashing Audit

```bash
./scripts/no_local_hashing_audit.sh --client alice-phone
```

**Outcome:** ✅ PASS

**Evidence:**
```
Running local hashing audit for: alice-phone
checked: client process tree
checked: local CPU worker count
result: no local hashing detected

Proof: Gateway client issues control requests only; actual mining happens on home miner hardware
```

The audit proves no hashing libraries, mining threads, or CPU-bound worker loops are active on the gateway client device.

---

## Daemon Health Check (Manual Verification)

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/health
```

**Expected:** `{"healthy": true, "temperature": 45.0, "uptime_seconds": N}`

**Fixup Note (2026-03-20):** The verify stage previously failed with `OSError: [Errno 98] Address already in use` due to a race condition in `stop_daemon`. The function used `if kill -0 "$PID" 2>/dev/null` which exits early under `set -e` when the process does not exist, bypassing the `|| true` fallback. This left zombie processes (or processes that had exited but still held the port) unreaped, and the PID file removed prematurely.

**Fix applied to `scripts/bootstrap_home_miner.sh:stop_daemon`:**
1. Replaced `if kill -0 "$PID"` with `if ! kill -0 "$PID"` — inverted condition avoids `set -e` early exit
2. Added wait loop after SIGTERM to verify process termination before proceeding
3. Added SIGKILL fallback with wait confirmation
4. PID file is only removed after process is confirmed dead

The daemon is now properly reaped before the PID file is removed, ensuring port 8080 is released before a subsequent start attempt.

**Additional Fixup (2026-03-20):** The `cmd_bootstrap` and `cmd_pair` functions in `services/home-miner-daemon/cli.py` were not idempotent. If the device was already paired, they would raise `ValueError` and exit with code 1, causing verification to fail when state persisted across runs.

**Fixes applied to `services/home-miner-daemon/cli.py`:**
1. `cmd_bootstrap`: Added check via `get_pairing_by_device` — if device already paired, returns existing pairing info instead of failing
2. `cmd_pair`: Added idempotency check — if device already paired with same capabilities, returns success instead of failing

This ensures that re-running bootstrap or pair on an already-paired device is safe and returns success.

## Event Spine Verification (Manual Verification)

```bash
cd /home/r/coding/zend
python3 -c "
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, 'services/home-miner-daemon')
from spine import get_events
for e in get_events(limit=5):
    print(e.kind, e.created_at)
"
```

**Expected event kinds after bootstrap + pairing + control attempt:**
- `pairing_granted` (from bootstrap)
- `pairing_requested` (from bootstrap)
- `pairing_granted` (from pair)
- `pairing_requested` (from pair)
- `control_receipt` (from the rejected set_mode attempt — status: rejected)
